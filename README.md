# Hot Shirtless Men (HSM)
HSM is a minecraft 1.8.9 mod that fixes bows and drills resetting on inventory updates (video showcase at the end)

Explanation:
  Minecraft has a bug which if two NBTs are even very slightly different it'll cause your current action to be broken, whether it being mining a block or pulling a bow.
This exact bug was fixed on vanilla 1.14.4 and this is what my mod does, it instead of comparing the whole ItemStack (NBT) it compares only the essential parts needed to confirm if its the same item or not which prevents your drill from resetting when trying to glide and prevents your bow from being reset with any inventory update. (bows reset upon any inventory changes because they kinda have your whole inventory in their NBT since they need to identify arrows, drills only reset upon the actual item itself changing (like the fuel update))

tldr: it fixes an annoying minecraft bug that got fixed on vanilla 1.14.4

If you think this mod is a cheat Mojang and Hypixel already tried fixing the Drill issue, and Hypixel already fixed the Bow issue on Skyblock. Stop coping.

Bow code is mine. The drill code idea was mostly from RoseGold's Mobx Drill.

Enjoy!

Known issues:
- Does not contain any rats (will add soonâ„¢)
- (Fixed on 1.0.4) It can sometimes crash while drawing a bow under very specific circumstances.
- (Fixed on 1.0.4) If you swap between the same type of items while mining it wont reset the mining progress which is an unintended behaviour.
