# Hot Shirtless Men (HSM)
HSM is a minecraft 1.8.9 mod that fix drills resetting on inventory updates (video showcase at the end)

## Changes from the official Repo: Removed all the Bow related features  

Explanation:
  Minecraft has a bug which if two NBTs are even very slightly different it'll cause your current action to be broken, when mining a block.
This exact bug was fixed on vanilla 1.14.4 and this is what my mod does, it instead of comparing the whole ItemStack (NBT) it compares only the essential parts needed to confirm if its the same item or not which prevents your drill from resetting when trying to glide.

tldr: it fixes an annoying minecraft bug that got fixed on vanilla 1.14.4

The drill code idea was mostly from RoseGold's Mobx Drill.

Enjoy!

Known issues:
- Does not contain any rats (will add soonâ„¢)

- (Fixed on 1.0.4) If you swap between the same type of items while mining it wont reset the mining progress which is an unintended behaviour.
